# GoogleDataAnalyticsCapstone
Capstone project for Google's Data Analytics Professional Certificate powered by Coursera.

This notebook contains my capstone project for Google's Data Analytics Professional Certificate.

The professional certificate consists of 8 courses structured around the phases of a data analysis project.

The courses forming part of the certificate use various tools for different phases of the project, introducing the relevant techniques via 
examples in spreadsheets, SQL, Tableau and R. We expand on this set of tools by bringing into the picture Python together with relevant libraries 
like NumPy, Pandas and MathplotLib. This approach also has the advantage of allowing the whole process to be executed in one place through the use 
of a Jupyter Notebook environment.
